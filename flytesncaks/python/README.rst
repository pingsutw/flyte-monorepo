This section provides some canonical examples of how to author tasks and workflows that are entirely written in python and do not need any additional dependencies to be installed from flytekit. The
aim is to provide canonical examples of various mechanics available in Flyte, and answer questions like
 - How to write a task - illustrated with an example?
 - How to write a workflow - illustrated with an example?
 - How to accept inputs and produce outputs from a task and a workflow?
 - How to use complex datatypes like - Schemas, Blobs and CSVs?
