# Containers and Tasks

Every task in Flyte can be associated with a container (This is not required). Every task in workflow can also have a **different container** - YES!

## Why this is not easily supported in flytekit

## Option I: Raw Container tasks

## Option II: Remote task fetch

## Option III: intelligent importing?
