Horovod
=========

Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet. 
The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use. It uses the all-reduce algorithm for fast 
distributed training rather than a centralized parameter server approach (all-reduce vs. parameter server).
