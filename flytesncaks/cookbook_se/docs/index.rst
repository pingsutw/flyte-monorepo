Flyte Cookbook
==============================================
This cookbook provides a hands on tutorial of various features in Flyte using flytekit, the platform's Python SDK. Flytekit is
intended to be useful even without Flyte backend. All the examples in this book are executable locally and we recommend the best way to try out
Flyte is to run these examples locally. If you have access to a whole Flyte platform deployment, this cookbook can also be used as a fully functional workflow repo.

The tutorial is divided into 3 sections:

* :ref:`Getting Started <sphx_glr_auto_core>` - This covers the basics of Flytekit, as well as working with a deployed Flyte platform.
* :ref:`Case Studies <sphx_glr_auto_case_studies>` - These are examples that showcase the power of Flyte.
* :ref:`Plugins <sphx_glr_auto_plugins>` - This section details flytekit extensibility
