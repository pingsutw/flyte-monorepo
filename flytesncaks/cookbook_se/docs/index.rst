Flyte Cookbook
==============================================
Flytesnacks is intended to be a ``learn by example`` style cookbook. We try to
cover all the various concepts in Flyte alongwith most of the maintained
plugins. This cookbook is currently designed to get you running locally and on
a Flyte cluster using the `flytekit - Flyte Python SDK
<https://github.com/lyft/flytekit>`_

For more details on Flyte refer to the `Homepage <https://flyte.org>`_. 
Documentation on how to install, configure, administer Flyte refer to
`Documentation <https://lyft.github.io/flyte/>`_
